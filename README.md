I discovered multiple subdomain takeover vulnerabilities affecting *.hackerone.com domains. Several subdomains are pointing to third-party services (GitHub Pages and Amazon CloudFront) without any active content hosted, leaving them in a dangling state.  An attacker can claim these services and fully control the vulnerable subdomains.
